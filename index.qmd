## Introduction

Learning involves organise **new** knowledge [@how-learning-works].
One way for us to "visualise" how knowledge is organise is using a mind map.

## Mistakes

Mistakes also contributes to someone's personal mind map / knowledge.

As a instructor, we can design the lesson to also include sections were the instructor makes mistakes.

## Example 1

This first example is based on Software Carpentry's "[Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)".

## Mistake 1.1

I like to teach `git init` before `git config` because `git` will show

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint:   git branch -m <name>
```

This allows me to help learners to read the output they get in the terminal.

## Mistake 1.2

I like to "forget" a closing single quote `'` the first time that I use `git commit` because I will end up with

```
$ git commit -m 'First commit
>
```

This allows me to remember students that `>` is a indicator that the shell is expecting a close token.

## Mistake 1.3

I like to make a typo the second time that I use `git commit` because it will allow me to mention `--amend` that is a question that learners always make.
